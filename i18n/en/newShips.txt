SHIP_YME|Y-ME Fission Retrofit

SHIP_YME_SPECS|Make: Angry Ex-Eon Interstellar Employees\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 1\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 5\nDry mass: 34,500 kg \nCargo bay: 140 m^3 \nProcessed cargo storage (per mineral): 11,000 kg

SHIP_YME_DESC|This ship was created by several annoyed employees of Eon Interstellar who split off due to how the company mismanaged both it's employees and PR. They banded together to create a more economically viable vessel, making the shining hull of the EIME more accessible to those outside of very well to do positions. \n\nDue to the nature of the EIME's original hull, a custom liquid-drum reactor had to be put in place, something many end-users wanted with the original vessel. An older reactor left over from K37s being decommissioned for Enceladus Prime's habitat constructions was used for the retrofit, being in common supply.

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE|OCP-209 Salvaged Hull

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE_SPECS|Make: Obonto Microengineering\nBay-Fitted Manipulator Arms: 1\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nTurret Mounts: 2\nDrone Bays: 2\nCrew: 8\nDry mass: 184,500 kg\nCargo bay: 150 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 50,000 kg

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE_DESC|This ship was found in a back alley behind Sin Space Engineering. We asked if we could take it and the (unpaid) intern working the atrium said he didn't care so we did. The entire bay has been cut out and replaced with a manipulator arm, we believe partially to make a competitor to the MAD-CERF, and partially because Sin Space Engineering didn't know what to do with the rest of the OCP after making their OK720 line of ships.

SHIP_CK65|CK-65

SHIP_CK65_SPECS|Make: Conlindo / Rusatom-Antonoff\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDrone Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 12\nDry mass: 82,000 kg \nCargo bay: 55 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (per mineral): 37,500 kg

SHIP_CK65_DESC|The rise of mineral processors gave a need for ships that could carry significant quantities of it for interplanetary travel. The century-old venture of the Cothon class of ships showed the viability of automated ships to be used for travel, and the Eagles were chosen as the ship of choice to complete the new venture. A large portion of it's cargo bay was gutted to fit 6 ginormous bays to store processed cargo, alongside a luxury living quarter space to house 12 passengers. A large portion of the Eagle's hardware was left in for the convenience of captains, however the grinder was replaced with a standard excavator to ensure a more reliable experience.

SHIP_CK69|CK-69

SHIP_CK69_SPECS|Make: Conlindo / Rusatom-Antonoff\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDrone Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 12\nDry mass: 102,000 kg \nCargo bay: 55 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 200,000 kg

SHIP_CK69_DESC|The success of the CK-65 led to a more advanced CK-69 to handle any quantity of ore, at the cost of a slightly lower total hold. It saw its use during dips in throughput at Enceladus, where space would be wasted on a stock CK-65 due to the lack of a specific mineral, however was very popular among miners who could bring back large quantities of ore more reliably.

SHIP_PROSPECTOR_RAM|Prospector RAM

SHIP_PROSPECTOR_RAM_DESC|Ringa Aftermarket Modification sacrifices cargo space for increased capabilities with salvages and counterfeit parts from various ship models. Vulture High-Stress Hardpoint modification, KR-37 electronics and sensors, Cothon Bender's variable processed resource storage, etc. RAM also has many original modification. The short wide cargo, the larger cargo door and larger grinder, reinforced and upgraded manipulator arm support, thrusters and torch turret system, reinforced reactor, etc. These come at the cost of very high ship mass for a ship its size, halved processed resource capacity, reduced crew capacity, and extremely high price. Prospector RAM can handle any situation in the ring, but its high mass and low capacity make it a mediocre mining ship.

SHIP_PROSPECTOR_RAM_SPECS|Maker: Unknown\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 1\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDrone Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 4\nDry Mass: 54,380 kg\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 40,000 kg\nEMP Shielding: 200 MW

SHIP_OCP213_TWIN|OCP-213 Twin

SHIP_OCP213_TWIN_SPECS|Make: Obonto Microengineering\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDocking Bays: 2\nTurret Mounts: 2\nCrew: 8\nDry mass: 187,500 kg\nCargo bay: 610 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 50,000 kg

SHIP_OCP213_TWIN_DESC|A minor modification to the stock OCP-209, the Twin adds a second torch fitting to allow for more varied maneuvers, especially when combining translation and rotation.



SHIP_TRTL_PEEPER|OCK Peeper TNTRL

SHIP_TRTL_PEEPER_DESC|A custom-fit modification of Sin Space Engineering's OK720. The crew habitat has been moved behind the cargo bay to make for a safer operation to keep impacts induced by mining be further away from where it could cause potential injury. The unorthodox shape of the front of the ship pushes the hardpoints vastly off-center, however the additional structural fittings on the bay permit for a high-stress hardpoint to be placed along the spine. \n\nDue to the nature of the repositioned crew habitat, a large lead radiation shield has been installed in between, alongside a free 150 mg per day supply of Ketron Isoboost being supplied to crews during and a month following a flight on this vessel.

SHIP_TRTL_PEEPER_SPECS|Make: Conlindo / Obonto Microengineering \nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 1 \nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 4 \nCrew: 4 \nDry mass: 101,400 kg \nCargo bay: 610 m^3 \nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 55,000 kg


SHIP_MADCERF_CIV_INVERSE|MAD-CERF (Inverted Civilian Refit)

SHIP_MADCERF_CIV_INVERSE_DESC|This civilian refit, made in collaboration with Obonto Microengineering, introduces a number of modifications for the diverse requirements of the ring environment. Its compact top-mounted habitat has been relocated to the bow and replaced with an expanded OCP-standard centrifuge, increasing its effective crew capacity to eight. Further, the docking bay has been enclosed with a mesh basket and the clamps removed to support mining operations, and its rear bulkhead bears an enormous sliding door for acceptance of large cargo. Much of the bow substructure has also been replaced by hold volumes, lending the vessel more processed mineral space than any other vessel on the civilian market.\n\nA third party modification to the Civilian modification puts the autopilot and visual sensors to flip forwards and put it excavator-first.

SHIP_MADCERF_CIV_INVERSE_SPECS|Make: Machines Astro-Dynamiques / Obonto Microengineering \nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 1 \nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2 \nTurret Hardpoints: 2 \nDrone Bays: 2 \nDocking Bays: 2 \nCrew: 6 \nDry mass: 195,000 kg \nCargo bay: 1,200 m^3 \nProcessed cargo storage (per mineral): 45,000 kg
